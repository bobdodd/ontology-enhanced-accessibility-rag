# Ontology-Enhanced RAG System for Web Accessibility

## üéØ Project Overview

An advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically designed for web accessibility knowledge management. This system handles diverse document types including academic papers, standards documents, expert blog posts, audit tickets, and testing transcripts, using ontology-enhanced retrieval for superior accuracy and relevance.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Multi-Document-Type Knowledge Base
- **Academic Papers**: ACM publications and peer-reviewed research
- **Standards Documents**: WCAG, Section 508, EN 301 549
- **Expert Blog Posts**: Content from WCAG authors and accessibility leaders
- **Audit Tickets**: Real-world accessibility issues and remediation
- **Testing Transcripts**: Screen reader and user testing sessions

### Ontology-Enhanced Retrieval
- **Technology Ontologies**: HTML, ARIA, CSS, JavaScript frameworks
- **Disability Ontologies**: Visual, Motor, Cognitive, Auditory impairments
- **Standards Ontologies**: WCAG success criteria, compliance levels
- **Testing Methodologies**: Automated, manual, and user testing approaches

## üöÄ Key Features

### Intelligent Query Processing
- **Intent Detection**: Automatically classifies queries (research, standards, implementation, testing)
- **Ontology Expansion**: Expands queries with related terms and concepts
- **Multi-Query Generation**: Creates diverse search variations for comprehensive results
- **Authority-Aware Ranking**: Weights results based on document type and author expertise

### Advanced Retrieval Pipeline
1. **Query Classification & Expansion**
2. **Document Type Filtering**
3. **Semantic Search within Filtered Collections**
4. **Authority-Based Reranking**
5. **Diversity & Completeness Optimization**

### Document Management
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Automatic document type detection and categorization
- **Author Authority Mapping**: Recognition of accessibility experts and standards authors
- **Version Control**: Tracking of standards updates and document revisions
- **Bulk Processing**: Efficient handling of large document collections (5,000+ papers)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Vector Database**: Chroma with multiple collections
- **Embeddings**: Ollama with domain-specific models
- **LLM**: Local deployment with Ollama
- **Framework**: LangChain for retrieval chain management
- **Frontend**: Streamlit with advanced document management UI
- **Ontology Storage**: JSON-LD for semantic relationships

## üìä Performance Targets

- **Scale**: Support for 5,000+ documents
- **Response Time**: Sub-2-second query processing
- **Relevance**: >90% user satisfaction on accessibility queries
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive results across all document types
